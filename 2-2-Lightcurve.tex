\subsection{Lightcurve}\label{sec:lightcurve}

Time series data and their analysis are a fundamental aspect of solar
physics for which many data sources are available.  In recognition of
this fact, SunPy provides a \texttt{LightCurve} object designed to
provide a convenient and consistent interface for handling solar time
series data.  The main engine behind the \texttt{LightCurve} object is
the \texttt{pandas} data analysis library (available at
\url{http://pandas.pydata.org}).  This library contains a large amount
of functionality for manipulating and analysing time series data,
making it an ideal basis for \texttt{LightCurve}.  Like other SunPy
objects, \texttt{LightCurve} is a wrapper around a data object, which
in this case is the \texttt{pandas} object.  \texttt{LightCurve}
assumes that the input data are time-ordered list(s) of numbers.  Each
list becomes a column in a \texttt{pandas} DataFrame object.

Currently, the \texttt{LightCurve} object is compatible with the
following data sources: the GOES X-ray Sensor (XRS), PROBA2/LYRA, and
the SDO EUV Variability Experiment (EVE; only the level ``OCS'' and
average CSV files - see \url{http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/eve/data/}
for more detail).  For each of these instruments, a sub-class of the
\texttt{LightCurve} object is initialised
(e.g. \texttt{GOESLightCurve, LYRALightCurve}) which inherits from
\texttt{LightCurve} but allows instrument-specific functionality to be
included.  Future developments will introduce support for additional
instruments and data products.  Since time series data is generally
relatively small and there is no established standard as to how it
should be stored and distributed, each SunPy \texttt{LightCurve}
object provides the ability to download its own data in its
constructor.

%\subsubsection{Creating and using Lightcurves}

A \texttt{LightCurve} object may be created using a range of different
methods.  Firstly, a \texttt{LightCurve} may be created for a specific
instrument based on an input time range. In Listing
\ref{code:goes_lc_code}, the LightCurve constructor searches remote
sites for the GOES X-ray data specified by the time interval,
downloads the required files and subsequently creates the object.

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{pycon}
>>> from sunpy import lightcurve
>>> goes=lightcurve.GOESLightCurve.create('2011-06-07 06:00',
...                                       '2011-06-07 08:00')
>>> goes.peek()
\end{minted}

2011 June 7 using a time range, and the result of the \texttt{peek()} method.}
\label{code:goes_lc}
\end{listing}

Alternatively, if the data file already exists on the local system,
the \texttt{Lightcurve} object may instead be initialised using that
file as input (see Listing \ref{code:lyra_lc}).

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{pycon}
>>> from sunpy import lightcurve
>>> file='lyra_20110607-000000_lev2_std.fits'
>>> lyra=lightcurve.LYRALightCurve.create(file)
>>> lyra.peek()
\end{minted}
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{lyra_lightcurve.pdf}
\caption{Creating a LYRA lightcurve for the full day of 2011 June 7 using an 
existing data file, and the result of the \texttt{peek()} method}
\label{code:lyra_lc}
\end{listing}

Once the \texttt{Lightcurve} has been created it may be manipulated in
a variety of ways in order to perform time series analysis.
Continuing from Listing~\ref{code:lyra_lc}, we show a few simple
examples of using a LYRA lightcurve.

In Listing~\ref{code:lyra_lc} we created a LYRA Lightcurve spanning
the full day of 2011 June 7.  To extract the sub-interval 06:00 -
07:00 UT into a new \texttt{Lightcurve} called \texttt{lyra\_zoom} we
simply do as shown on Listing~\ref{code:lyra_truncate}.

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{pycon}
>>> from sunpy.time import TimeRange
>>> trange=TimeRange('2011-06-07 06:00','2011-06-07 07:00')
>>> lyra_zoom = lyra.truncate(trange)
\end{minted}
\caption{Extracting a sub-interval from a Lightcurve.}
\label{code:lyra_truncate}
\end{listing}

Also from the example shown in Listing~\ref{code:lyra_lc}, direct access to 
the data and time information in the object is available through 
\texttt{lyra.data} and \texttt{lyra.data.index} respectively 
(see Listing~\ref{code:lyra_pandas}).

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{pycon}
>>> print lyra.data
<class pandas.core.frame.DataFrame>
DatetimeIndex: 1496629 entries, 2011-01-28 00:00:00.110000 to
